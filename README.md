### Hello! I'm James :)

    ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Sparta Global.
    ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and SQL.
    ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment (sorry).
    ðŸ’¬ Ask me about working remotely.
    ðŸ“« How to reach me: GitHub or Smoke Signals
    âš¡ Fun fact: I am not the Dragon of Dojima but I feel like I know him.
